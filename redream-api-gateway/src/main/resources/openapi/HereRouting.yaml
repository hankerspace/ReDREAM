        **Alpha**: This API is not yet stable and is subject to change.

        A route handle encodes a previously calculated route. A route can be decoded from a handle
        as long the service uses the same map data which was used during encoding.

        All parameters of the `/routes` endpoint are supported, except for `destination`, `via`,
        `alternatives` and `routingMode`. See also the `return` parameter of `/routes` endpoint.

        The `origin` parameter can be provided to update the start of the previously calculated
        route.

        The `transportMode` parameter does not have to match the transport mode previously used for
        route calculation. However, when using a different transport mode, the request may fail,
        e.g. when the route has road segments forbidden for the provided transport mode.

        Avoid routes that violate certain features of road network or that go through
        user-specified geographical bounding boxes.

        Note that if the origin, destination, or any via is in an avoided area or on an avoided
        feature, a route is produced that violates the avoid restriction. In such a case, the
        route is trying to minimize the violation of the avoid restrictions and can therefore
        include large deviations from a route that is calculated without these avoid
        restrictions.

        It is also possible that the produced route violates the avoid restriction in between
        waypoints, if no other route is possible or too hard to find. One such example is
        requesting a route to an island that is only reachable with ferries while specifying
        `avoid[features]=ferry`.

        Further, avoid can cause the route calculation to fail, if no route is possible or too
        hard to find.

        Specify properties using array notation like `avoid[features]=controlledAccessHighway,tunnel`.

        ## Format

        Format: `Place[WaypointOptions]`

        * Place: `{lat},{lng}[PlaceOptions]`
        * PlaceOptions: `;option1=value1;option2=value2...`
        * WaypointOptions: `!option1=value1!option2=value2...`

        A waypoint consists of:

        * Exactly one place
        * Optional settings for the place
        * Optional settings for the waypoint itself

        Supported place options:

        * `course`: int, degrees clock-wise from north. Indicating desired direction at the place.
          E.g. `90` indicating `east`. Often combined with `radius` and/or `minCourseDistance`
        * `sideOfStreetHint`: `{lat},{lng}`. Indicating the side of the street that should be
          used. E.g. if the location is to the left of the street, the router will prefer using
          that side in case the street has dividers. E.g.
          `52.511496,13.304140;sideOfStreetHint=52.512149,13.304076` indicates that the `north`
          side of the street should be preferred. This option is required, if `matchSideOfStreet`
          is set to `always`.
        * `matchSideOfStreet`: enum `[always, onlyIfDivided]`. Specifies how the location set by
          `sideOfStreetHint` should be handled. Requires `sideOfStreetHint` to be specified as
          well.
          + `always` : Always prefer the given side of street.
          + `onlyIfDivided`: Only prefer using side of street set by `sideOfStreetHint` in case
            the street has dividers. This is the default behavior.
        * `nameHint`: string. Causes the router to look for the place with the most similar name.
          This can e.g. include things like: `North` being used to differentiate between
          interstates `I66 North` and `I66 South`, `Downtown Avenue` being used to correctly
          select a residental street.
        * `radius`: int, meters. Asks the router to consider all places within the given radius as
          potential candidates for route calculation. This can be either because it is not
          important which place is used, or because it is unknown. Radius more than 200meter are
          not supported.
        * `minCourseDistance`: int, meters. Asks the routing service to try find a route that avoids actions for
          the indicated distance. E.g. if the origin is determined by a moving vehicle, the user
          might not have time to react to early actions.

        Supported waypoint options:

        * `stopDuration`: desired duration for the stop, in seconds. The section arriving at this
          via waypoint will have a `wait` post action reflecting the stopping time. The
          consecutive section will start at the arrival time of the former section + stop
          duration.
        * `passThrough`: option is not supported for 'destination'.

        Notes:

        * Non-structural reserved characters in options' values need to be properly percent-encoded.
          Please refer to the developers' guide for more details.

        Format: `Place[WaypointOptions]`

        * Place: `{lat},{lng}[PlaceOptions]`
        * PlaceOptions: `;option1=value1;option2=value2...`
        * WaypointOptions: `!option1=value1!option2=value2...`

        A waypoint consists of:

        * Exactly one place
        * Optional settings for the place
        * Optional settings for the waypoint itself

        Supported place options:

        * `course`: int, degrees clock-wise from north. Indicating desired direction at the place.
          E.g. `90` indicating `east`. Often combined with `radius` and/or `minCourseDistance`
        * `sideOfStreetHint`: `{lat},{lng}`. Indicating the side of the street that should be
          used. E.g. if the location is to the left of the street, the router will prefer using
          that side in case the street has dividers. E.g.
          `52.511496,13.304140;sideOfStreetHint=52.512149,13.304076` indicates that the `north`
          side of the street should be preferred. This option is required, if `matchSideOfStreet`
          is set to `always`.
        * `matchSideOfStreet`: enum `[always, onlyIfDivided]`. Specifies how the location set by
          `sideOfStreetHint` should be handled. Requires `sideOfStreetHint` to be specified as
          well.
          + `always` : Always prefer the given side of street.
          + `onlyIfDivided`: Only prefer using side of street set by `sideOfStreetHint` in case
            the street has dividers. This is the default behavior.
        * `nameHint`: string. Causes the router to look for the place with the most similar name.
          This can e.g. include things like: `North` being used to differentiate between
          interstates `I66 North` and `I66 South`, `Downtown Avenue` being used to correctly
          select a residental street.
        * `radius`: int, meters. Asks the router to consider all places within the given radius as
          potential candidates for route calculation. This can be either because it is not
          important which place is used, or because it is unknown. Radius more than 200meter are
          not supported.
        * `minCourseDistance`: int, meters. Asks the routing service to try find a route that avoids actions for
          the indicated distance. E.g. if the origin is determined by a moving vehicle, the user
          might not have time to react to early actions.

        Notes:

        * `stopDuration` option is not supported for `origin`, contrary to `destination` and
          `via` waypoints.
        * `passThrough`: option is not supported for 'origin'.
        * Non-structural reserved characters in options' values need to be properly percent-encoded.

          the indicated distance. E.g. if the origin is determined by a moving vehicle, the user
          might not have time to react to early actions.

        Supported waypoint options:
        * `stopDuration`: desired duration for the stop, in seconds.
        * `passThrough`: boolean. Asks the router to avoid the following during route calculation:
          + Introducing a stop at the waypoint.
          + Splitting the route into sections.
          + Changing the direction of travel.

          Following scenarios are not supported for `passThrough` parameter:
          + Setting both `stopDuration` to a value greater than 0 and `passThrough=true`.
          + Setting `passThrough=true` for `origin` or `destination` of a route.
          The default value is `false`.

        Notes:

        * Non-structural reserved characters in options' values need to be properly percent-encoded.

        * `summary` - Include summary for the section.
        * `travelSummary` - Include summary for the travel portion of the section.
        * `turnByTurnActions` - Include all information necessary to support turn by turn guidance to complete the section.
        * `mlDuration` - Use a region-specific machine learning model to calculate route duration. **Disclaimer: This parameter is currently in beta release, and is therefore subject to breaking changes.**
        * `elevation` - Include elevation information in coordinate and geometry types. See e.g. `polyline` or `location`.
        * `routeHandle` - Encode calculated route and return a handle which can be used with
          `routes/{routeHandle}` to decode the route at a later point in time.
        * `passthrough` - Include information on passthrough via waypoints in the section.
        * `incidents` - Include a list of all incidents applicable to each section.
                        Incidents are localized to the requested language.

          cases, the route returned by the `fast` mode may not be the route with the fastest
          possible travel time. For example, the routing service may favor a route that remains on
          a highway, even if a faster travel time can be achieved by taking a detour or shortcut
          through an inconvenient side road.
        * `short`: Route calculation from start to destination disregarding any speed information.
          In this mode, the distance of the route is minimized, while keeping the route sensible.
          This includes, for example, penalizing turns. Because of that, the resulting route will
          not necessarily be the one with minimal distance.

            A reference to a routing zone in HMC.

            The standard representation of a routing zone reference has the following structure:
            `{catalogHrn}:{catalogVersion}:({layerId})?:{tileId}:{zoneId}`

            The individual parts are:
            * `catalogHrn`: The HERE Resource Name that identifies the source catalog of the routing zone, example: `hrn:here:data::olp-here:rib-2`
            * `catalogVersion`: The catalog version
            * `layerId` (optional): The layer inside the catalog where the routing zone is located, example: `environmental-zones`
            * `tileId`: The HERE tile key of the partition/tile where the routing zone is located in the given version of the catalog
            * `zoneId`: The identifier of the referenced routing zone within the catalog, example: `here:cm:envzone:3455277`

            Example of a reference to an environmental zone in standard form:
            `hrn:here:data::olp-here:rib-2:1557:environmental-zones:all:here:cm:envzone:3455277`

            In order to reduce reponse size, routing zone references can also be provided in a compact representation.
            In compact form, parts of a reference are replaced by placeholders, which can be resolved using the `refReplacements` dictionary in the parent section.
            The placeholder format is `\$\d+` and needs to be surrounded by columns or string start/end. It can be captured with the following regular expression: `(^|:)\$\d+(:|$)`

            Example of the aforementioned environmental zone reference in compact form: `$0:$1:3455277`
            With the corresponding `refReplacements`:
            ```
            "refReplacements": {

For example, `52.511496,13.304140;sideOfStreetHint=52.512149,13.304076` indicates that the `north` side of the street should be preferred. This options is required, if `matchSideOfStreet` is set to `always`.
        * `matchSideOfStreet`: enum `[always, onlyIfDivided]`. Specifies how the location set by `sideOfStreetHint` should be handled. Requires `sideOfStreetHint` to be specified as well. Note the exception above when combined with `course`.
          + `always` : Always prefer the given side of street.
          + `onlyIfDivided`: Only prefer using side of street set by `sideOfStreetHint` in case the street has dividers. This is the default behavior.
        * `nameHint`: string. Causes the router to look for the place with the most similar name. The typical examples include: `North` being used to differentiate between interstates `I66 North` and `I66 South`, `Downtown Avenue` being used to correctly select a residental street.
        * `radius`: int, meters. Instructs the router to consider all places within the given radius as potential candidates for route calculation. This can be either because it is not important which place is used, or because it is unknown. Radiuses wider than 200 meters are not supported.
        * `minCourseDistance`: int, meters. Instructs the routing service to try to find a route that avoids actions for the indicated distance. For example, if the origin is determined by a moving vehicle, the user might not have time to react to early actions.

        Supported waypoint options:
        * `stopDuration`: desired duration for the stop, in seconds.
        * `passThrough`: boolean. Asks the router to avoid the following during route calculation:
          + Introducing a stop at the waypoint.
          + Splitting the route into sections.
          + Changing the direction of travel.

        Following scenarios is not supported for `passThrough` parameter:
          + Setting both `stopDuration` to a value greater than 0 and `passThrough=true`.
          + Setting `passThrough=true` for `origin` or `destination` of a route.
          The default value is `false`.

            **Disclaimer: This property is currently in beta release, and is therefore subject to breaking changes.**

            The directed topology segment id including prefix (e.g '+here:cm:segment:').

            The id consists of two parts.
            * The direction ('+' or '-')
            * followed by the topology segment id (a unique identifier within the HERE platform catalogs).

            The direction specifies whether the route is using the segment in its canonical direction ('+' aka traveling along the geometry's direction), or against it ('-' aka traveling against the geometry's direction).
          type: string
        segmentRef:
          description: |
            A reference to the HMC topology segment used in this span.

            The standard representation of a segment reference has the following structure:
            {catalogHrn}:{catalogVersion}:({layerId})?:{tileId}:{segmentId}(#{direction}({startOffset}..{endOffset})?)?

            The individual parts are:
            * catalogHrn: The HERE Resource Name that identifies the source catalog of the segment, example: hrn:here:data::olp-here:rib-2
            * catalogVersion: The catalog version
            * layerId (optional): The layer inside the catalog where the segment can be found, example: topology-geometry
            * tileId: The HERE tile key of the partition/tile where the segment is located in the given version of the catalog. This can be on a lower level than the actual segment is stored at (for example, the provided tile ID can be on level 14, despite topology-geometry partitions being tiled at level 12). The level of a HERE tile key is indicated by the position of the highest set bit in binary representation. Since the HERE tile key represents a morton code of the x and y portion of the Tile ID, the level 12 tile ID can be retrieved from the level 14 tile ID by removing the 4 least significant bits (or 2 bits per level) or 1 hexidecimal digit. For example, the level 14 tile 377894441 is included in the level 12 tile 23618402 (377894441<sub>10</sub> = 16863629<sub>16</sub> &rightarrow; 1686362<sub>16</sub> = 23618402<sub>10</sub>)
            * segmentId: The identifier of the referenced topology segment inside the catalog, example: here:cm:segment:84905195
            * direction (optional): Either '*' for undirected or bidirectional, '+' for positive direction, '-' for negative direction, or '?' for unknown direction (not used by the routing service)
            * startOffset/endOffset (optional): The start- and end offset are non-negative numbers between 0 and 1, representing the start and end of the referenced range using a proportion of the length of the segment. 0 represents the start and 1 the end of the segment, relative to the indicated direction (or positive direction in case of undirected segments). Example: 0.7..1

            Example of a segment reference in standard representation:
            hrn:here:data::olp-here:rib-2:1363::377894441:here:cm:segment:84905195#+0.7..1

            The segment references can also be provided in a compact representation, to reduce the response size. In the compact representation, some parts are replaced by placeholders, which can be resolved using the refReplacements dictionary in the parent section.
            The placeholder format is \$\d+ and need to be surrounded by columns or string start/end. It can be captured with the following regular expression: (^|:)\$\d+(:|$)

            Example of the segment reference previously mentioned in compact representation:
            $0:377894441:$1:84905195#+0.7..1
            With the corresponding refReplacements:
            "refReplacements": {
              "0": "hrn:here:data::olp-here:rib-2:1363:",

            **Disclaimer: This property is currently in beta release, and is therefore subject to breaking changes.**

            The directed topology segment id including prefix (e.g '+here:cm:segment:').

            The id consists of two parts.
            * The direction ('+' or '-')
            * followed by the topology segment id (a unique identifier within the HERE platform catalogs).

            The direction specifies whether the route is using the segment in its canonical direction ('+' aka traveling along the geometry's direction), or against it ('-' aka traveling against the geometry's direction).
          type: string
        segmentRef:
          description: |
            A reference to the HMC topology segment used in this span.

            The standard representation of a segment reference has the following structure:
            {catalogHrn}:{catalogVersion}:({layerId})?:{tileId}:{segmentId}(#{direction}({startOffset}..{endOffset})?)?

            The individual parts are:
            * catalogHrn: The HERE Resource Name that identifies the source catalog of the segment, example: hrn:here:data::olp-here:rib-2
            * catalogVersion: The catalog version
            * layerId (optional): The layer inside the catalog where the segment can be found, example: topology-geometry
            * tileId: The HERE tile key of the partition/tile where the segment is located in the given version of the catalog. This can be on a lower level than the actual segment is stored at (for example, the provided tile ID can be on level 14, despite topology-geometry partitions being tiled at level 12). The level of a HERE tile key is indicated by the position of the highest set bit in binary representation. Since the HERE tile key represents a morton code of the x and y portion of the Tile ID, the level 12 tile ID can be retrieved from the level 14 tile ID by removing the 4 least significant bits (or 2 bits per level) or 1 hexidecimal digit. For example, the level 14 tile 377894441 is included in the level 12 tile 23618402 (377894441<sub>10</sub> = 16863629<sub>16</sub> &rightarrow; 1686362<sub>16</sub> = 23618402<sub>10</sub>)
            * segmentId: The identifier of the referenced topology segment inside the catalog, example: here:cm:segment:84905195
            * direction (optional): Either '*' for undirected or bidirectional, '+' for positive direction, '-' for negative direction, or '?' for unknown direction (not used by the routing service)
            * startOffset/endOffset (optional): The start- and end offset are non-negative numbers between 0 and 1, representing the start and end of the referenced range using a proportion of the length of the segment. 0 represents the start and 1 the end of the segment, relative to the indicated direction (or positive direction in case of undirected segments). Example: 0.7..1

            Example of a segment reference in standard representation:
            hrn:here:data::olp-here:rib-2:1363::377894441:here:cm:segment:84905195#+0.7..1

            The segment references can also be provided in a compact representation, to reduce the response size. In the compact representation, some parts are replaced by placeholders, which can be resolved using the refReplacements dictionary in the parent section.
            The placeholder format is \$\d+ and need to be surrounded by columns or string start/end. It can be captured with the following regular expression: (^|:)\$\d+(:|$)

            Example of the segment reference previously mentioned in compact representation:
            $0:377894441:$1:84905195#+0.7..1
            With the corresponding refReplacements:
            "refReplacements": {
              "0": "hrn:here:data::olp-here:rib-2:1363:",
              "1": "here:cm:segment"
